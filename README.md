### Description
This project is a part of Techtonica's curriculum ([source]("https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/main/projects/eventonica")), where the goal is to make an event management web application. The app will "let users browse from a variety of events and save the ones they are interested in." 

This app utilizes React, Postgres, and Express.

### Project Requirements

- **Events**
  - Add a new Event
  - Delete an Event
  - Search for events...
    - by date
    - by category
- **Users**
  - Add a new User
  - Delete a User
  - A User can...
    - *favorite* an Event
    - *unfavorite* an Event
    - view their list of previously favorite events

#### Build instructions

All the required packages can be installed using the following command in the project directory:
```
npm install
```

First start the server by using `npm start` in that directory, then start the app by running `npm start` in the client directory.

### Progress

- The app has been re-made using React and has a proper API using Express
- Visually it is not very clean, but the focus is on function, rather than visuals.
